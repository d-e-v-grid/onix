Onix is a modern infrastructure orchestration and configuration management system built with TypeScript. It provides SSH-based task execution, playbook system (similar to Ansible), inventory management, and a pluggable task system for automating infrastructure operations.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Onix follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Core Package** (`@onix-js/core`) - Core orchestration engine with all business logic
- **CLI Application** (`@onix-js/cli`) - Command-line interface for interacting with the system

## üì¶ Packages

### Core Engine (`@onix-js/core`)

The core package contains all the business logic for infrastructure orchestration:

- **Playbooks** - Task execution workflows similar to Ansible playbooks
- **Inventory Management** - Host and group management with SSH configuration
- **Task System** - Pluggable task execution (Shell, Copy, SSH, Composite)
- **SSH Client** - Secure remote execution with connection pooling
- **Logging & Metrics** - Structured logging with Prometheus metrics
- **Template Engine** - Variable substitution and templating
- **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error management with retry policies
- **Event System** - Event-driven architecture for extensibility

### CLI Application (`@onix-js/cli`)

Command-line interface providing:

- **Deploy Commands** - Execute playbooks on target hosts
- **Inventory Management** - List and manage hosts and groups
- **Playbook Operations** - List and manage available playbooks
- **Metrics Export** - Prometheus metrics for monitoring
